1. Class and Obj (Examples)
2. Class has data/attributes and function/Methods
    > Code walkthrough
    > attributes get called itself , Methods are called manually
3.  Why Python is called OOPs ? everything in Python is an object (data structure , datatyoe etc)
4. Advantages of the OOPS concept :
     > you can create your own datatype
     > debugging
     > easy to colab
     > code reusability

5. End to End Project(Chatbook)
    > function Vs method
    > magic or dender method -> constructor
    > self
    > you can create attribute outside of class as well
    > Encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method

    > Inheritance
